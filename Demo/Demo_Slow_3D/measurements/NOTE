#========How to set up measurements========================#

Two necessary Input measurement sets to run the code :

1) Raw Sinogram photon count measurements, so that the projections and weights can be computed from these measurements, 

                        OR

2) Providing Sinogram Projections and Weights as direct inputs

In case 1), the necessary input files need to stored in the local folder “PhotonCounts”, and the other folders are left empty.

Where as, in case 2), the necessary input files are stored in the local folders “Projections” and “Weights”, while the “PhotonCounts”
folder is left empty.

Note : The parameter files in “../parameters” are the same in both cases.


#=======Input Measurements File Formats==============#

The format for the input files are listed below: 

A) The Sinogram Projections measured for the 3-D volume are organized slice by slice in a single directory, in this case under local folder “Projections”.
   All files within this directory must share a common BaseFileName and follow the below format :
   <ProjectionsBaseFileName>_slice<SliceIndex>.2Dsinodata
   , where "SliceIndex" is a non-negative integer indexing each slice and is printed with 4 digits. Eg : 0000 to 9999 is a valid descriptor for "SliceIndex"

B) Similarly, the Sinogram Weights, measured for the 3-D volume are organized slice by slice in a single directory, in this case under local folder “Weights”.
   All files within this directory must share a common BaseFileName and follow the below format :
   <WeightsBaseFileName>_slice<SliceIndex>.2Dsinodata
   , where "SliceIndex" is a non-negative integer indexing each slice and is printed with 4 digits. Eg : 0000 to 9999 is a valid descriptor for "SliceIndex"


C) Similarly, the Sinogram Photon-counts, measured for the 3-D volume are organized slice by slice in a single directory, in this case under local folder “PhotonCounts”.
   All files within this directory must share a common BaseFileName and follow the below format :
   <PhCountsBaseFileName>_slice<SliceIndex>.2Dsinodata
   , where "SliceIndex" is a non-negative integer indexing each slice and is printed with 4 digits. Eg : 0000 to 9999 is a valid descriptor for "SliceIndex"
