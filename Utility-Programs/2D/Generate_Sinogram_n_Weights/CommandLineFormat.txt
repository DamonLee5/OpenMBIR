#COMMAND LINE FORMAT

#Generate Projections and Weights
#Command line format:
#./<Executable File Name> -p <InputFileName>[.2Dphcountdata]  -j <InputFileName>[.sinoparams] -s <OutputFileName>[.2Dsinodata] -w <OutputFileName>[.2Dweightdata]

# Note : The necessary extensions for certain input files are mentioned above within a "[ ]" symbol
# However, they are NOT to be included as part of the file name in the command line arguments.

# If sinogram projections and weight data are already available as input measurements, then skip this step
# Else generate the projections and weights from photon count measurements as shown below

#Example
args_appl="-p $DirName/measurements/$Fname -j $DirName/parameters/$Fname -s $DirName/Reconstruction/$Fname "\
"-w  $DirName/Reconstruction/$Fname"
