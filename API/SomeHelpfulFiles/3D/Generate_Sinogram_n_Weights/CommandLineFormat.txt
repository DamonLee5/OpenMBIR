#COMMAND LINE FORMAT

#Generate Projections and Weights from application-specific raw photon count measurements
#Command line format:
#./<Executable File Name> -j <InputFileName>[.sinoparams] -p <InputPhotonCountsBaseFileName> -s <OutputProjectionsBaseFileName> -w <OutputWeightsBaseFileName>

# Note : The necessary extensions for certain input files are mentioned above within a "[ ]" symbol
# However, they are NOT to be included as part of the file name in the command line arguments.

# If sinogram projections and weight data are already available as input measurements, then skip this step
# Else generate the projections and weights from photon count measurements as shown below

#Example
args_appl="-j $DirName/parameters/$Fname -p $DirName/measurements/PhotonCounts/$Fname -s $DirName/measurements/Projections/$Fname "\
"-w $DirName/measurements/Weights/$Fname"
./Generate_Sinogram_n_Weights/Gen_Projections_and_Weights $args_appl
